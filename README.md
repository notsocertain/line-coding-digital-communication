**Overview**
This repository serves as a resource for learning and implementing various line coding techniques in digital communication systems. Line coding is a fundamental aspect of digital communication where binary data is converted into a sequence of signals suitable for transmission over a communication channel

Types of line coding implemented
1. Unipolar
2. Polar
3. Bipolar
4. Manchester
5. Differential Manchester
6. NRZ
7. RZ
8. AMI
